    <p>
        I'm very happy to finally offer you this new release. And I hope that I didn't miss to much bugs.
        The FoundryVTT community and module users contributed to the development of this module. With feedback,
        suggestions, translations, bug reports and code 🤫.
    </p>
    <p>
        Translation is partly done. It's partly done for German, Portuguese, French,
        Portuguese (Brazil), Italian and Japanese. You can take a look at <a href="https://localazy.com/p/lootsheet-npc5e">localazy</a>
        or the project repo to see the or contribute to the translations.

    <h4>Development approach</h4>
    <p>
        The current attempt on my behalf (Daniel) was/is to enable GMs to more effectively offer NPC tokens
        which allow players to loot or purchase items. And now also allowing players to sell(/store) items.
        And this, with less manual work needed from the GM.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        In the future I would like to see integration with other modules. And several other module developers
        already expressed interest in working on that. These will hopefully be things like integration with importers
        and generators (EEEG, MrPrimate), quality of life improvements when integrating with Quick Encounters. <br />
        With the current version you can use the seeder in addition to the GM settings to add loot to NPCs.<br />
        Consider installing <a href="https://github.com/ghost-fvtt/FVTT-Autocomplete-Inline-Properties" target="_blank">AIP</a>
        so you can more easily add filters for this feature. <br /> A future version will bring import export features for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        The styling options added, hopefully allow GMs to make interaction with the sheet more immersive.
        Other feature requests are in planing phase or at least on my roadmap.
    </p>

        When creating bug reports it is often useful to paste the output or screenhots of the browser console.
        If the bug generates any errors/warnings.
