        Consider the module as still work in progress. We have some great ideas for the future.
        And also hope you like the new features, already brought into the module.<br />
        The Foundry community and module users contributed to the development of this module. With Feedback,
        suggestions, translations, bug reports and code ü§´.

    <p>
        Translation is partly done. Currently we have partial translations for: German, Portuguese, French,
        Portuguese (Brazil), Italian and Japanese. You can see <a href="https://localazy.com/p/lootsheet-npc5e">Localazy</a>
        for translation progress.

        The current attempt on my behalf (Daniel) was/is to enable GMs to more effectively offer NPC tokens
        which allot players to loot or purchase items. While now also allowing players to sell(/store) items.
        And this, with less manual work needed from the GM.<br />
        I added the options to add styling or custom backgrounds to the sheet. Looting/Buying should now work
        across scenes. Chat messages should be more appealing and informative and the content is mostly linked.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the future I would like to see integration with other modules. And several other module developers
        already expressed interest in working on that. This will hopefully be things like integration with importers
        and generators (EEEG, MrPrimate), quality of life improvements like Quick Encounter. With the current version
        you can use the seeder in addition to the GM settings to add loot to NPCs.<br />
        Consider installing <a href="https://github.com/ghost-fvtt/FVTT-Autocomplete-Inline-Properties" target="_blank">AIP</a>
        so you can more easily add filters for this feature.
    </p>
    <p>
        The styling options added hopefully allow GMs to make interaction with the sheet more immersive. It could even be used to indicate
        give story hints or show special sheet styles for special NPCs.
        Other feature requests are in planing phase or at least on my roadmap.
